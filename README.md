# Go WebSockets & HTMX Chat Application

This project demonstrates a simple chat application using Go for the backend with WebSockets for real-time communication and HTMX for enhancing frontend interactivity without writing JavaScript.

## Features

- Real-time messaging between clients using WebSockets.
- Minimalistic frontend using HTMX to dynamically update the chat without full page reloads.
- Concurrent handling of multiple clients with Go's goroutines and synchronization primitives.

## Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.13 or later recommended)
- Basic knowledge of HTML and the HTTP protocol

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbdulALmotalebHussain/go-htmx-chat.git
cd go-htmx-chat
```

## Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run the server:

```sh
go run .
```

By default, the server starts on port 8080. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the application in action.

## How It Works

- The server is implemented in Go using the `gorilla/websocket` package for handling WebSocket connections.
- Clients connect to the server via a WebSocket connection established at the `/ws` endpoint.
- Messages sent by a client are broadcast to all connected clients in real-time.
- The frontend uses HTMX to dynamically update the chat interface.
